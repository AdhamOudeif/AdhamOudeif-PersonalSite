          <h1>Welcome to my personal site!</h1>
          <p>
              On the verge of gaining my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, I decided to create this personal website to showcase
              my accomplishments and skills. While I specialize in Full Stack Web Development, I am also expereinced in software development
              in both Java and C++. Recently, I have been developing many applications with Andriod Studio, utilzing Model-View-Control architecture
              to create effecient apps with clean code. This summer I plan on attaining an internship and completing Google's UX Design course.
          </p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
